# Often, when dealing with iterators, we also get need to keep a count of iterations.
# Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task.
# Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerating object.
# This enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted -
# into a list of tuples using the list() function.

# We can format it and take the index in another variable, hence we can use interations in this way.
