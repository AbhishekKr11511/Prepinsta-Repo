# Sequence types in Python
# 1. Lists
# 2. Tuples
# 3. Range
# 4. String

# Anything you can iterate over is an iterable
# Basically if you can use a for loop or a while loop with it you can iterate on it
# If objects contain the following methods it is iterable :
    # __iter__
    #__getitem__
# Indexing must also start with 0

# All sequence types are iterable types.
# However all iterable are not sequence types.
